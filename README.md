Update 14/04/2016:

TinderView
========

Created A Simple and Beautiful Tinder like card deck & Captain Train like toolbar.

This is heavily based on [AndroidSwipeableCardStack](https://github.com/wenchaojiang/AndroidSwipeableCardStack), wenchaojiang has written the library very well but i faced a lot of difficulty integrating it & that's the reason i built this app so that you dont waste time. Use this repo as a base for your app & build on top :).

API 19 and UP.

In Action

The demo is now available, dont forget to give it 5 stats if it helped you. Oh if you can contribute to development of the library in anyway i would love to see your pull request. 

Happy Coding!
